# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

[SDLC](https://stackify.com/what-is-sdlc/) works by lowering the cost of software development while simultaneously improving quality and shortening production time. SDLC achieves these apparently divergent goals by following a plan that removes the typical pitfalls of software development projects. That plan starts by evaluating existing systems for deficiencies.
		1.  Identify the Current Problems
		2.  Plan
		3.  Design
		4.  Build
		5.  Code Test
		6.  Software Deployment
